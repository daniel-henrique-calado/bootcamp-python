# Classroom 02

## Objective

The purpose of this class, it's show some basic operations for the most simple data types in Python: `int`, `float`,
`bool` and `str`.

## `int` type

### Exercise 01

Receives two integers numbers and print out sum.

```bash
Enter a value: 10
Enter other value: 20
Sum between 10 and 20 is: 30
```

### Exercise 02

Receives a integer number and print a mod operation by 5

```bash
Enter a number: 20
Remainder of division of 20 by 5 is: 0
```

### Exercise 03

Receives two integers numbers from user interface and print out the product.

```bash
Enter a number: 3
Enter other number: 2
The product between 3 and 2 is: 6
```

### Exercise 04

Read two numbers from user and print out integer division 
between the first and second number on this order.

```bash
Enter a number: 6
Enter other number: 2
The division of 6 and 2 is: 3
```

### Exercise 05

Calculate a square from a given number.

```bash
Enter a number: 6
The square of 6 is: 36
```

## `float` type

### Exercise 06

Calculate the sum of two float numbers.

```bash
Enter a value: 10
Enter other value: 20
Sum between 10.0 and 20.0 is: 30.0
```

### Exercise 07

Calculate the mean between two float numbers.

```bash
Enter a value: 10
Enter other value: 20
The mean between numbers 10.0 and 20.0 is: 15.0
```

### Exercise 08

Calculate the power between two numbers given by user. 
The first number must be the base and second the exponent.

```bash
Enter a value: 8
Enter other value: 2
The number 8.0 elavate to 2.0 results: 64.0
```

### Exercise 09

Convert a Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit scale.


```bash
Enter a temperature in °C: 30
The temperature 30.0 °C equals to 86.0 °F.
```

### Exercise 10

Calculate a circle area using radio informed by user.

```bash
Enter the circle radius: 5
The area of the circle of radius 5.0 is: 78.54
```

## `str` type

### Exercise 11

Transform a user name to uppercase.

```bash
Enter your name: daniel
Your formatted as uppercase: DANIEL
```

### Exercise 12

Transform a full user name to lower case.

```bash
Enter your full name: Givanildo Batista Hulk
Your fullname formatted as lowercase:  givanildo batista hulk
```

### Exercise 13

Remove blank space at the beginning and end of a given phrase.

```bash
Enter a phrase:   Testing, removing blank spaces                 
Blank space were removed at beggining and end: Testing, removing blank spaces
```

### Exercise 14

Extract and print out a day, month and year from
date on the following format "DD/MM/YYYY".

```bash
Enter a date using the following format (DD/MM/AAAA): 18/07/1998
Day: 18
Month: 07
Year: 1998
```

### Exercise 15

Concatenate two strings given by user.

```bash
Enter a string: apple
Enter other string: orange
Concatenated strings: appleorange
```

## `bool` type

### Exercise 16

Evaluate two boolean values given by user, using a AND operator.

```bash
Enter a boolean (0 or 1): 0
Enter other boolean (0 or 1): 1
AND operation between the informed booleans: False
Type: <class 'bool'>, Value: False
Type: <class 'bool'>, Value: True
```

### Exercise 17

Evaluate two boolean values given by user, using a OR operator.

```bash
Enter a boolean (0 or 1): 0
Enter other boolean (0 or 1): 1
OR operation between informed booleans: True
Type: <class 'bool'>, Value: False
Type: <class 'bool'>, Value: True
```

### Exercise 18

Apply a NOT operator on a boolean value.

```bash
Enter a boolean (0 ou 1): 1
NOT operation applied to the boolean: False
```

### Exercise 19

Check if two numbers are equal.

```bash
Enter a number: 12
Enter other number: 6
The equality between numbers 12 and 6 is: False
```

### Exercise 20

Check if two numbers are different.

```bash
Enter a number: 1
Enter other number: 1
The inequality between the numbers 1 and 1 is: False
```

## `try/except`

### Exercise 21

Convert a Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit and implement try-except to validate the data.

```bash
Enter a temperature in °C: 33
The temperature 33.0 °C is equals to 91.4 °F.
```

### Exercise 22

Verify if a word is a palindrome.

```bash
Enter a word: ovo   
The word 'ovo' is palindrome? True
```
### Exercise 23

Simple calculator: enter two float/int values and
asks for a operator (+,-,*,/). 
Print out the results or a error message. 

```bash
Enter a number: 8
Enter other number: 2
Which operation do you want to execute (+,-,*,/): /
The division between 8.0 e 2.0 é: 4.0
```

### Exercise 24

Inform with given number is positive, negative or zero. Check if is odd or even.

```bash
Enter a number: 7
The number 7 is positive.
The number 7 is odd.
```

### Exercise 25

Asks for list of int numbers, separated by comma and check if
all numbers of the list are integers.

```bash
Enter a list of comma-separated integers (,): 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
The whole list is made up of integers: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7].
```
